# Streaming Service and Analysis
Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.  In this project, I will programme a model of Netflix in Python. Subsequently, I will conduct data analysis on Netflix shows. 

This was my final project for my module, ST101, Programming for Data Science.
